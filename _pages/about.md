After 2 years spent working for the [Innovation, Data and Experiments in Education (IDEE) program](https://www.idee-education.fr/) at J-PAL Europe, I am now a PhD student at the Department of Economics, Sciences Po, under the supervision of [Clément de Chaisemartin](https://sites.google.com/site/clementdechaisemartin/) and [Carlo Barone](https://www.sciencespo.fr/cris/en/directory/barone-carlo/). I am working on the evaluation of education policies, mostly in France. But I am open to doing research in development economics, and labor economics.
